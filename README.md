# wordle-project
this is a wordle guessing tool  
Install package  
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will probably first have to download the word list using nltk's download() function. The following code should give you a GUI window to select the data you want (look for "words" under the "Corpora" tab):  
`
import nltk
nltk.download()
`
